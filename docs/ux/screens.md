# Screens

**Web surfaces:** yes — public static pages; visible copy, canonical URLs and structured data are available without JavaScript.

Design system: [PassionCode](../../design-system/README.md), existing static HTML components. No new Figma file. Identity update with existing layout language; motion level 5 (foundation → Motion): entrances, one scrubbed rail, the hero map loop — never a dependency. Observable targets: primary CTA visible in first desktop viewport, OS requirements beside each download, no horizontal overflow on mobile, keyboard-visible links and summaries.

### SCR-01: Home
**Scenarios:** SCN-001, SCN-006, SCN-007, SCN-008, SCN-010, SCN-012, SCN-013, SCN-016. Reading order (2026-10-05): hero (canonical headline, Start free → /start/, For companies → /business/, current versions, the workplace map) → vision (do what you love) → How it works (#toolkit, four steps on a rail) → three paths (#start) → the tools (#products, current versions) → For builders (#extend, #launcher) → company teaser (#companies) → open source (#source) → FAQ → About → closing. The header is unchanged; it gains only a scrolled shadow and a hover underline. Footer adds Get started, For companies, Privacy and the commercial address.
**Web surface:** public
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/
**Answers:** What is PassionCode and which product can I use today?
**Indexable:** yes; canonical URL and sitemap.
**Without JS:** complete copy, product links and download CTA.
**Entity:** PassionCode.ai organization/toolkit, linked to Switchboard and Fabric.

### SCR-02: Switchboard
**Scenarios:** SCN-002/003/004/011. Reading order: hero → Get Switchboard (macOS and Windows cards, a full-width Before you open it card with CLI/OS/Windows requirements, SHA-256 list, release links, beta note) → The problem (limits run out; rotation keeps the session open) → synthetic screenshot → features → For agents (only for a selected release ≥ 0.4.0-beta.1: `switchboard mcp`, project rules, connect commands, the plugin line once the launcher lists it) → first session → FAQ → Part of the PassionCode toolkit → closing.
**Release-bound parts:** only `data-release-*` elements, the `<!-- release:NAME -->` regions (`macos-note`, `checksums`, `license-current`, `agents`) and the JSON-LD `softwareVersion`/`license` change with `switchboard/release.json`; `scripts/switchboard-release.mjs` renders them, `npm run check` asserts the page equals the render and that the MIT-history sentence still names v0.3.1-beta.1.
**Web surface:** public
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/switchboard/
**Answers:** What does Switchboard do and where can I download it?
**Indexable:** yes; canonical product URL, SoftwareApplication data and sitemap. Redirect endpoints noindex.
**Without JS:** requirements, checksums, beta limits, download/source links, agent connect commands and native details/summary FAQ. Checksums and commands wrap at 390 px.
**Entity:** Fabric Switchboard, open-source (AGPL-3.0) desktop account workbench from PassionCode.ai.

### SCR-04: Project Observatory
**Scenarios:** SCN-006. Purpose, synthetic screenshot, features, setup steps, limits and FAQ.
**Web surface:** public
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/observatory/
**Answers:** What does Project Observatory show, what does it read, and how do I start?
**Indexable:** yes; canonical product URL, SoftwareApplication data and sitemap.
**Without JS:** complete copy, setup steps, source and guide links, native details/summary FAQ.
**Entity:** Project Observatory, open-source (AGPL-3.0) local dashboard from PassionCode.ai (English or Russian interface).

### SCR-03: Design system
**Scenarios:** SCN-005, SCN-010. Shared identity and product marks (including Fabric Dashboards), color roles, typography and reusable CSS.
**Web surface:** public
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/design-system/
**Answers:** Which shared visual rules do PassionCode products use?
**Indexable:** yes; canonical URL and sitemap.
**Without JS:** all visual rules and link to canonical CSS tokens.
**Entity:** PassionCode design system v1.0, adopted by the website, Switchboard and Project Observatory.

Screens describe public website behavior, not acceptance of native Switchboard or Fabric runtime.

### SCR-05: Fabric
**Scenarios:** SCN-007, SCN-008. Early-preview hero with Download for macOS, illustrative project brief, the actual window on synthetic demo data (home, board, releases), intended operating loop, people/authority principles, Get Fabric with requirements (the "Before you open it" card links /fabric/agents/, SCR-08), limits, the MCP status (no entry for other agents yet), the public source and its license, and links back to About or Switchboard.
**Web surface:** public
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/fabric/
**Answers:** What is Fabric and what is being built?
**Indexable:** yes; canonical URL, WebPage data and sitemap. The download redirect is noindex.
**Without JS:** all content, navigation, requirements and the download link. No fake functional agent demo or waitlist.
**Entity:** Fabric, the CEO AI agent within PassionCode.ai, in early preview.

### SCR-06: Fabric Inbox
**Scenarios:** SCN-009. Development-preview hero with Download for macOS, what it does, Get Fabric Inbox (requirements, checksum, release notes, limits), For agents (key and MCP command), toolkit context and FAQ.
**Web surface:** public
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/inbox/
**Answers:** What does Inbox do and can I use it today?
**Indexable:** yes; canonical URL, SoftwareApplication data naming the selected release and the AGPL, and sitemap. The download redirect is noindex.
**Without JS:** all content, the download link, checksum, agent steps, sibling product links and native FAQ.
**Entity:** Fabric Inbox, Fabric's mail tool from PassionCode.ai, a desktop mail client in development preview, open source under AGPL-3.0.

Inbox falsifier: a reader could mistake the preview for a finished product or a working generic IMAP/Outlook offering. The development-preview status appears in the first viewport, and the unverified parts are repeated beside the download. Composition follows the existing product page; no new animation or visual direction is introduced.

### SCR-07: Fabric Dashboards
**Scenarios:** SCN-010. Hero → practical service utility → download and requirements → agent setup → FAQ → sibling tools.
**Web surface:** public
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/dashboards/
**Answers:** What does Fabric Dashboards do, which services appear, and how do I install it?
**Indexable:** yes; canonical URL, sitemap and versioned SoftwareApplication data.
**Without JS:** complete page, download/checksum, MCP command and native FAQ.
**Entity:** Fabric Dashboards, macOS service dashboard from PassionCode.ai, AGPL-3.0, release 0.3.1.

Workplace update: the home directory precedes the work cycle and long product descriptions. Six entry points show utility and status; #extend owns launcher/Adapter instructions and source-build projects. Identity, headline and token palette are preserved. No new motion or component framework. Falsifiers: a product lacks a next action; a preview appears finished; the visitor mistakes the launcher for a desktop-app installer; a command or directory card clips at 390 px.

### SCR-08: Get started
**Scenarios:** SCN-013, SCN-015. Hero with an on-page table of contents → four steps (#launcher, #fabric, #build, #run) with copyable commands and current versions → #contribute (three steps, public repository list, internal repositories named as collaborator-only) → closing to /business/.
**Web surface:** public
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/start/
**Answers:** How do I install the workplace and make my first agent?
**Indexable:** yes; HowTo structured data.
**Without JS:** complete; commands are selectable text.

### SCR-09: For companies
**Scenarios:** SCN-014. Hero with the four-step funnel → segments (#cases) → estimate formula (#estimate) → engagement (#engagement) → setup options (#options) → the request form (#request) → FAQ.
**Web surface:** public
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/business/
**Answers:** What could agents take over in my company, and how do I start?
**Indexable:** yes; Service and FAQPage structured data.
**Without JS:** the form is one page posting to /api/leads; the estimate formula and example are static text.

### SCR-10: Request received
**Scenarios:** SCN-014. Confirmation for the no-JavaScript path, with the email fallback.
**Web surface:** public, `noindex`
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/business/thanks/

### SCR-11: Privacy notice
**Scenarios:** SCN-017. Controller, data, purposes and legal bases, storage locations, retention, rights, browser draft, the apps.
**Web surface:** public
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/privacy/
### SCR-12: Fabric: supported coding agents
**Scenarios:** SCN-018. Intro (as-of date, direct answer) → three levels → Connected table → Runs in Fabric table → Planned table in order, then desktop apps and editors → ACP → why these agents (OpenRouter, dated) → account switching with Download for macOS and Explore Switchboard.
**Route:** https://passioncode.ai/fabric/agents/
**Answers:** Which coding agents does Fabric work with, and what does "works with" mean?
**Indexable:** yes; canonical URL, WebPage data with `dateModified` and a breadcrumb, sitemap.
**Without JS:** the whole answer, every table and every official-site link.
**Entity:** Fabric, the CEO AI agent within PassionCode.ai; the agents are named with their own official sites.
Falsifiers: an agent appears at two levels or a planned agent reads as connected; a table clips at 320 px; the page quotes an OpenRouter share as a number; the date is missing. Existing tokens and section patterns only; the one new component is a token-styled table.
